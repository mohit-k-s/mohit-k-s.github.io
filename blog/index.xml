      <title>Tea Breaks are best</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven’t worked a lot of jobs. Haven’t had too many coworkers either. Some were good, some forgettable, some… just there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But every now and then, someone stands out. Not because of their resume or technical chops (though that helps), but because of who they are — how they carry themselves, how they make you want to be better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At my current job, I had someone like that. Yesterday was his last day in the company.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven’t worked a lot of jobs. Haven’t had too many coworkers either. Some were good, some forgettable, some… just there.</p>
<p>But every now and then, someone stands out. Not because of their resume or technical chops (though that helps), but because of who they are — how they carry themselves, how they make you want to be better.</p>
<p>At my current job, I had someone like that. Yesterday was his last day in the company.</p>
<p>He joined as an IC from a pretty amazing org, and I connected with him almost instantly. Here’s what I learned from him:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be a great listener but don&rsquo;t be afraid to speak up</li>
<li>Think in systems and not just in the immediate context</li>
<li>Try to create a culture of learning and growth</li>
<li>You can be a little weird</li>
<li>Explore the unknown and don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail (You might be wrong, but that&rsquo;s okay)</li>
</ul>
<p>He believed that culture matters more than whatever metrics get flashed in monthly review calls. I second that.</p>
<p>If you think about it , you’ll realize that what matters is the people and the vision. Not headcount. Not burn numbers. Great companies aren’t great because they’re big. They’re great because they have the right people doing meaningful work.</p>
<p>Of course, office politics ruin everything. And they’re inevitable when non-technical folks run the show. But you can choose not to be part of it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="silicon-valley">Silicon Valley</h3>
<p>We talked a lot about Silicon Valley — the show. I’ve watched it countless times. It’s probably the best representation of this industry we work in.</p>
<p>Everything starts with an idea. Then power, metrics, and VC expectations creep in. But it’s the journey that matters. Richard didn’t take that 10 mn dollars offer — not because he’s an idiot (well, &ldquo;RIGBY&rdquo; but he does have serious issues) — but because he believed in something.</p>
<p>That still counts for something. I might nerd out about this show at length in some other post.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="tea-breaks">Tea Breaks</h3>
<p>One random day i got a text from him, just one word</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tea ?</p></blockquote>
<p>I was like &ldquo;why ? I am not a tea person&rdquo; but then I thought about it and I was like &ldquo;why not ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we went to the tea shop. It wasn’t fancy, but it was great. We talked about TV shows, philosophy, random tech, and even weirder things. I remember him asking me:<br>
<em>“Do you know how a helicopter flies? What’s so special about the blades?”</em></p>
<p>One of the recurring themes was how we’re made to feel like we’re not good enough — and how that feeds the rat race.
It made me think things and finally come to realise that I’m part of that too. I didn’t choose this field because I loved it as a kid. I’m not the coder who started at 12.</p>
<p>And always the converation ended with this quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can just do things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well it will be difficult though, but sure we can do it.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s off to explore the unknown and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be great at it.
He sent me this in the teams chat , classic right ?</p>
<p><img src="../see_you_again.gif" alt="See you again"></p>
<p>I’ll miss those tea breaks and the conversations.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday , I noticed this weird error in logs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2025-07-30 10:00:00.000 UTC [1] LOG:  operator does not exist: uuid = record at character 50&#xA;2025-07-30 10:00:00.000 UTC [1] LOG:  statement: SELECT (orders.id) FROM order WHERE orders = ($1, $2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was immediately clear this was a bug—the query attempts to compare a column to a record, which is not valid syntax in Postgres using the &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I brought it up with the developers and QA responsible for the feature, they insisted it had been tested and was working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday , I noticed this weird error in logs.</p>





<pre tabindex="0"><code>2025-07-30 10:00:00.000 UTC [1] LOG:  operator does not exist: uuid = record at character 50
2025-07-30 10:00:00.000 UTC [1] LOG:  statement: SELECT (orders.id) FROM order WHERE orders = ($1, $2)</code></pre><p>It was immediately clear this was a bug—the query attempts to compare a column to a record, which is not valid syntax in Postgres using the <code>=</code> operator.</p>
<p>When I brought it up with the developers and QA responsible for the feature, they insisted it had been tested and was working as expected.</p>
<p>This prompted me to take a closer look. My assumption was that the intent here was to check whether <code>orders</code> matched <em>any</em> of the values, which would require using the <code>IN</code> operator, like:</p>





<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="line"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="cl"><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">orders</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">order</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">orders</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">IN</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Turns out they didn&rsquo;t expect multiple values and the use case only expected one entry in array , which of course will work fine. But the language in code was something that did expect array.</p>
<p>What was not clear to me is who is to blame?</p>
<p>Lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your query supports only one value, enforce it.</li>
<li>If your query supports multiple values, use the right operator.</li>
<li>And most importantly: test what you write, especially with different shapes of input.</li>
</ul>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;common-distributed-systems-lingo&#34;&gt;Common Distributed Systems Lingo&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few terms that keep popping up when you work with distributed systems.

<p>There are a few terms that keep popping up when you work with distributed systems. They&rsquo;re often thrown around casually, and it’s easy to nod along without fully understanding them. I’m collecting those here with simple definitions and examples. This list will evolve as I keep learning.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="fencing-token">Fencing Token</h2>
<p>I was reading <a href="https://avi.im/blag/2024/s3-log/#:~:text=a%20concept%20of-,fencing%20tokens.,-I%E2%80%99ve%20left%20this">V&rsquo;s blog</a> and he mentioned fencing token. This word was introduced in Martin&rsquo;s blog <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>fencing token</strong> is a number (usually monotonically increasing) that helps prevent <strong>split-brain writes</strong> or <strong>duplicate actions</strong> in distributed systems.</p>
<p>It’s commonly used in <strong>distributed locks</strong>. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>Let’s say two nodes both believe they hold a lock (due to clock drift or network delays). Without fencing, both might write to a shared resource. With fencing, each action is tagged with a <strong>token</strong> (say, 41 and 42). The system can reject the one with the lower token, assuming it’s stale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Only the action with the highest fencing token is considered valid.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This way, even if the lock coordination fails, the system can still reject outdated operations.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="network-partition">Network Partition</h2>
<p>A <strong>network partition</strong> is when a group of nodes in a distributed system can no longer talk to another group — not because the nodes have failed, but because something in the network is blocking communication between them.</p>
<p>Think of it as the system getting split into isolated islands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A partition is about communication failure, not node failure.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A node can talk to nodes A and B, but not to node C. That’s a network partition.</li>
<li>Someone misconfigures firewall rules between two subnets. That’s a network partition.</li>
<li>NACLs (Network Access Control Lists) are misconfigured to block traffic between nodes.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the movie &ldquo;Her&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m building an AI companion with a beautiful 3D sphere interface and pure voice interaction. No words on screen - just visual conversation with AI.</p>
<h2 id="-where-i-am-now">🎯 Where I Am Now</h2>
<p><strong>Core Experience Working:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>✅ 3D sphere that responds to conversation states</li>
<li>✅ Voice recognition and AI responses (Google Gemini)</li>
<li>✅ Smooth, meditation-like transitions</li>
<li>✅ Press spacebar to talk, AI responds naturally</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-the-visual-magic">🎨 The Visual Magic</h2>
<p>The sphere morphs through four states:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idle</strong>: Gentle breathing, peaceful colors</li>
<li><strong>Listening</strong>: Green tones, focused attention</li>
<li><strong>Thinking</strong>: Blue contemplation, slow rotation</li>
<li><strong>Speaking</strong>: Warm amber, gentle waves</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recent Update:</strong> Made all animations super gentle and soothing - like meditation rather than sci-fi action.</p>
<h2 id="-tech-stack">🛠️ Tech Stack</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: TypeScript + Three.js + GSAP</li>

      <title>From Static Analysis to AI: My Journey Building a Git Diff Impact Analyzer</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="you-changed-a-line-what-did-you-break">You Changed a Line. What Did You Break?</h2>
<p>You push a change. CI passes. Days later, production breaks. Why?<br>
Because that &ldquo;simple&rdquo; change rippled into places you didn&rsquo;t know existed.</p>
<p>I got tired of tools telling me <em>what changed</em>, but never <em>what it meant</em>.<br>
So I built a system that answers the real question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;What changed—and why does it matter?&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This post is about how I moved beyond syntax-based static analysis and into <strong>semantic impact analysis using LLMs</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="part-1-the-traditional-approach">Part 1: The Traditional Approach</h1>
<h2 id="my-first-attempt-static-analysis">My First Attempt: Static Analysis</h2>
<p>I started with what most engineers try first: writing my own static analyzer. I called it <code>reverse-mapper</code>. The idea was to trace every file, function, and variable, and then reverse-map how a change propagates.</p>
<h3 id="the-3-phase-pipeline">The 3-Phase Pipeline</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dependency Tree</strong>: Entry point detection and BFS traversal (<code>index.js</code>, <code>app.js</code>, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Function &amp; Variable Mapping</strong>: Track usage, definitions, and references</li>
<li><strong>Reverse Impact Mapping</strong>: Link every variable to the functions and APIs it might affect</li>
</ol>
<p>It worked. Kind of.</p>
<h2 id="the-reality-check-why-static-analysis-wasnt-enough">The Reality Check: Why Static Analysis Wasn&rsquo;t Enough</h2>
<p>Once I started using it on real projects, the limitations became obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>🧩 <strong>No semantic understanding</strong>: It couldn&rsquo;t infer business logic</li>
<li>🔨 <strong>Maintenance nightmare</strong>: JS, TS, different module systems, ASTs</li>
<li>🧵 <strong>No runtime or conditional logic</strong>: Missed dynamic behavior</li>
<li>🧠 <strong>No “why” behind the changes</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="part-2-the-ai-revolution">Part 2: The AI Revolution</h1>
<h2 id="the-breakthrough-semantic-understanding-with-llms">The Breakthrough: Semantic Understanding with LLMs</h2>
<p>What if instead of just parsing code, I asked an LLM to <strong>understand</strong> it?</p>
<p>Modern LLMs like GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand intent and business logic</li>
<li>Trace dependencies <strong>semantically</strong></li>
<li>Recommend what tests to run</li>
<li>Evaluate <strong>risk</strong> and <strong>impact</strong></li>
<li>Suggest <strong>deployment strategies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This was a shift from &ldquo;what is connected?&rdquo; to <strong>&ldquo;why does this change matter?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h2 id="building-the-ai-powered-analyzer">Building the AI-Powered Analyzer</h2>
<p>I scrapped the AST parsing and built a much simpler—but more powerful—pipeline:</p>
<h3 id="the-4-step-ai-pipeline">The 4-Step AI Pipeline</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>🔍 Extract the Git Diff</strong></li>
<li><strong>📁 Gather Relevant Files</strong> (imports, touched files, neighbors)</li>
<li><strong>🧠 Ask the AI</strong> (via structured prompts)</li>
<li><strong>📊 Return Actionable Insights</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The obvious limitation with AI analysis is context windows. Large codebases can&rsquo;t fit in a single prompt, and even if they could, the analysis quality degrades significantly with massive context.</p>
<p>My solution was <strong>intelligent batching</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Token-aware splitting</strong> - Estimate token count and create optimal batches</li>
<li><strong>Rate limiting</strong> - Respect API limits with delays between requests</li>
<li><strong>Exponential backoff</strong> - Retry failed requests with increasing delays</li>
<li><strong>Graceful degradation</strong> - Continue analysis even if some batches fail</li>
<li><strong>Smart merging</strong> - Combine batch results into a unified analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach lets me analyze projects of any size while maintaining quality and staying within API limits.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-ai-providers-options-for-every-need">Multiple AI Providers: Options for Every Need</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to lock myself into a single AI provider, so I built support for multiple options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> - Best value for code analysis with huge context windows</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI GPT-4</strong> - Highest quality but most expensive</li>
<li><strong>Anthropic Claude</strong> - Good balance of quality and cost</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="local-models-ollama">Local Models (Ollama)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CodeLlama</strong> - Specialized for programming tasks</li>
<li><strong>Mistral</strong> - Fast general-purpose analysis</li>
<li><strong>DeepSeek Coder</strong> - Optimized for speed on smaller systems</li>
</ul>
<p>The local model integration was crucial for privacy-conscious projects where sending code to external APIs wasn&rsquo;t acceptable.</p>
<h2 id="local-vs-cloud-the-trade-offs-i-discovered">Local vs Cloud: The Trade-offs I Discovered</h2>
<p>Through extensive testing, I found clear patterns in when to use each approach:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Factor</th>
          <th>Local Models (Ollama)</th>
          <th>Cloud Models</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Privacy</strong></td>
          <td>Perfect - code stays local</td>
          <td>Risky - code sent externally</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Cost</strong></td>
          <td>Free after setup</td>
          <td>$0.50-2.00 per analysis</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Speed</strong></td>
          <td>Slower (45-90 seconds)</td>
          <td>Faster (15-30 seconds)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Quality</strong></td>
          <td>Good (75% accuracy)</td>
          <td>Excellent (85% accuracy)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Setup</strong></td>
          <td>Complex - requires local resources</td>
          <td>Simple - just API key</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>For my workflow, I use local models for regular development and reserve cloud models for critical production analysis.</p>
<h2 id="performance-benchmarks-the-reality">Performance Benchmarks: The Reality</h2>
<p>I benchmarked both approaches on a real 50,000-line codebase:</p>

          <th>Method</th>
          <th>Analysis Time</th>
          <th>Accuracy</th>
          <th>Cost</th>
          <th>Best Use Case</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>Traditional Static</strong></td>
          <td>2-3 seconds</td>
          <td>60%</td>
          <td>Free</td>
          <td>CI/CD quick checks</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>AI Cloud</strong></td>
          <td>15-30 seconds</td>
          <td>85%</td>
          <td>$0.50-2.00</td>
          <td>Comprehensive reviews</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><strong>AI Local</strong></td>
          <td>45-90 seconds</td>
          <td>75%</td>
          <td>Free</td>
          <td>Privacy-focused analysis</td>

<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding business impact</strong> of code changes</li>
<li><strong>Providing actionable recommendations</strong> for testing and deployment</li>

<li><strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong> - Fast enough for every commit</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-hybrid-approach">The Hybrid Approach</h3>
<p>My current setup uses both:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional analysis for pre-commit hooks (speed)</li>

<p>This AI-powered approach opens up exciting possibilities I never considered with static analysis:</p>

<li><strong>Intelligent deployment strategies</strong> - AI guides rollout based on change impact</li>
<li><strong>Technical debt analysis</strong> - Understanding code quality implications</li>
<li><strong>Cross-team notifications</strong> - AI identifies which teams need to know about changes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Static analysis served its purpose, but AI represents a fundamental paradigm shift in how I understand code changes. By leveraging the semantic understanding of large language models, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand code contextually</strong>, not just syntactically</li>
<li><strong>Get actionable insights</strong> instead of raw connection data</li>
<li><strong>Scale to any codebase</strong> with intelligent batching</li>
<li><strong>Choose the right tool</strong> for each situation (traditional, cloud AI, local AI)</li>
<li><strong>Actually trust and use</strong> the analysis results</li>
</ul>
<p>The era of AI-powered development tools is here. Traditional static analysis isn&rsquo;t dead—it still has its place for speed-critical use cases. But for understanding the true impact of code changes, AI is simply superior.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still relying on manual code review and intuition to understand change impact, you&rsquo;re missing out on a transformative approach that can make your development process safer, faster, and more intelligent.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m continuing to refine this approach with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better prompt engineering for more accurate analysis</li>
<li>Custom fine-tuning for specific codebases and domains</li>
<li>Integration with more development tools and workflows</li>
<li>Hybrid models that combine the speed of static analysis with the intelligence of AI</li>
</ul>
<p>The future of code analysis is here, and it&rsquo;s powered by artificial intelligence.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I made my first post—and I promised myself I’d continue writing, just like I used to back in 10th grade. There’s something deeply fulfilling about writing. I’ve missed that feeling for a long time, and now I’m trying to find my way back to it. So here I am. We’d start with what starts things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creativity (noun): the use of imagination or original ideas to create something</p></blockquote>
<p>Creativity, as we all know, is one of the fundamental pillars on which the entire arc of human evolution rests.
If not for original ideas, we’d still be hunting for food and hiding from the cold.</p>
<p>At its core, creativity is the act of combining our mental capacities and taking what’s already available and reshaping it into something new.
This new “thing” doesn’t have to be grand. It can be a poem, a cooling machine, a ziplock bag, or a story whispered by firelight.</p>
<p>Creativity is not limited to the arts. It lives in engineering, cooking, survival, protest, play. It’s how we’ve adapted, improved, and often just endured.
It’s invention born not only from inspiration, but from constraint.</p>
<p>When was the last time you created something ? When was the last time you sat down and just gave your best to do something by yourself , with just what you know. There’s something about that feeling, right?</p>
<p>That quiet intensity. That sense of this is my work.</p>
<p>Of course, people take help—and that’s not wrong. We’re not meant to be experts at everything.
But still—there’s a certain joy, a deep satisfaction, in being completely immersed in the one thing you love.
To create something original.</p>
<p>I enjoy writing and you might enjoy knitting, that last piece in which you made a cool pattern surely is the word of mouth.</p>
<p>Why ?
Creating is often linked to immediate benefits—for society, and for yourself.
Make something useful, and the world might reward you with recognition, money, maybe even status.</p>
<p>That’s fine. There’s no shame in it. But pause for a moment.
Ask yourself: Do you create to live, or live to create?</p>
<p>There’s something quietly romantic—almost defiant—about calling yourself an original.
About making something not because it’s useful, but because it had to be made.
Not for profit, not for praise. Just for the act. For the joy.</p>
<p>No judgment, though. I respect all creators—the practical, the poetic, the ones who ship, and the ones who scribble on napkins and never show a soul.</p>
<p>But if you’re someone who feels that strange pull to make things that don’t quite have a reason yet, keep going.
That’s the kind of creation that changes things.</p>
<p>How ?
The why is simple—it’s the spark that gets you going. But it’s not enough. To actually create something, you have to put in the hours. The people you admire weren’t creators from the start—they were learners. That’s the part people often skip. You have to be willing to learn, to fail, and to repeat the process over and over again. Obsess over it.</p>
<p>Create with so much intensity that it borders on madness—because the truth is, creativity isn’t a lightning strike.</p>
<p>In this era of knowledge, everything is within reach. Imagine Newton—the greatest of all time—having access to the tools and information we have today. The possibilities would’ve been endless. But here’s the thing: you also live in this era. You, too, can do what you dream of. It’s just not going to happen overnight. Real creation takes time.</p>
<p>And it will demand things from you that most people aren’t willing to give up—comfort, distraction, certainty. I know that’s debatable, but it’s often the trade for creating something truly great. History is full of that proof. The people who changed things didn’t always live balanced lives—but they lived driven ones. If you’re willing to pay that price, even in small doses, the doors are wide open.</p>
<p>But does that mean you can’t call small wins a win? Not at all. That’s the best part. In the art of creation, everything new is new. Every small step forward counts. A sentence written, a sketch finished, a bug finally fixed—they all matter. You don’t need to change the world to call yourself a creator. You just need to keep creating.</p>
<p>What ?
This one’s simple—it can be anything. Anything that already exists and just needs a little polishing, or something that doesn’t exist yet at all. It could be a new music piece, a sketch, a blog post, an app , or even your next dish.</p>
<p>The “what” of creation isn’t fixed. That’s the beauty of it. There are a thousand answers, and they’re all valid. What matters is that you decide to make something.
