Hello stranger on internet , I'm **Mohit Kumar**, just another backend engineer trying to have some fun while learning new things.


## About Me

After reading *Show your work* by Austin Kleon, I've embraced the practice of learning in public. I regularly revisit *<mark>The Almanack</mark> of Naval Ravikant* for inspiration and wisdom.

I write about tech and other stuff. It can be anything from system design to distributed systems to performance to code analysis to experiments to minimalism.
