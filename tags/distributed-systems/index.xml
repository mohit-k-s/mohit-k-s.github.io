<p>There are a few terms that keep popping up when you work with distributed systems. They&rsquo;re often thrown around casually, and it’s easy to nod along without fully understanding them. I’m collecting those here with simple definitions and examples. This list will evolve as I keep learning.</p>

<h2 id="fencing-token">Fencing Token</h2>
<p>I was reading <a href="https://avi.im/blag/2024/s3-log/#:~:text=a%20concept%20of-,fencing%20tokens.,-I%E2%80%99ve%20left%20this">V&rsquo;s blog</a> and he mentioned fencing token. This word was introduced in Martin&rsquo;s blog <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>fencing token</strong> is a number (usually monotonically increasing) that helps prevent <strong>split-brain writes</strong> or <strong>duplicate actions</strong> in distributed systems.</p>
<p>It’s commonly used in <strong>distributed locks</strong>. Here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<p>Let’s say two nodes both believe they hold a lock (due to clock drift or network delays). Without fencing, both might write to a shared resource. With fencing, each action is tagged with a <strong>token</strong> (say, 41 and 42). The system can reject the one with the lower token, assuming it’s stale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Only the action with the highest fencing token is considered valid.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This way, even if the lock coordination fails, the system can still reject outdated operations.</p>

<h2 id="network-partition">Network Partition</h2>
<p>A <strong>network partition</strong> is when a group of nodes in a distributed system can no longer talk to another group — not because the nodes have failed, but because something in the network is blocking communication between them.</p>
<p>Think of it as the system getting split into isolated islands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A partition is about communication failure, not node failure.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A node can talk to nodes A and B, but not to node C. That’s a network partition.</li>
<li>Someone misconfigures firewall rules between two subnets. That’s a network partition.</li>
<li>NACLs (Network Access Control Lists) are misconfigured to block traffic between nodes.</li>
</ul>
