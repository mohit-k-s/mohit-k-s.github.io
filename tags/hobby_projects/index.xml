<p>Well use <em><strong>google maps</strong></em> ?
Yes of course i can. But for some reason that is not the goto for everyone.</p>
<p>I built this metro navigation app for myself. The design isn&rsquo;t perfect (yet), but it works. Here&rsquo;s how I put it together.
One might ask , why ? To that i have no answer as i just thought that this can be cool !</p>

<h2 id="the-data-challenge">The Data Challenge</h2>
<p>Building any transit app starts with data—lots of it. I needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>All metro stations with accurate coordinates</li>
<li>Line connections and routes</li>
<li>Station elevations (for that authentic metro map feel)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="station-data-collection">Station Data Collection</h3>
<p>I started with the official DMRC website, manually extracting all lines and stations. Getting coordinates was trickier. My first attempt used <a href="https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/">Nominatim</a>, OpenStreetMap&rsquo;s geocoding service, but the results were disappointing—many stations were missing or had wildly inaccurate locations.</p>
<p>Plan B: Google Maps API. More reliable, but required careful rate limiting and cost management.</p>
<p>The final dataset lives in <a href="https://github.com/mohit-k-s/meteo/blob/main/public/dmrc.json">dmrc.json</a> on GitHub. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>250+ metro stations</li>
<li>Coordinate data for each station</li>
<li>Line connections and transfers</li>
<li>(Mostly fictional) elevation data</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-elevation-problem">The Elevation Problem</h3>
<p>Metro maps show elevation changes, but this data isn&rsquo;t publicly available. My current solution? I generated random elevations that look reasonable. Not ideal, but functional.</p>
<p>Future plan: Use OCR on official metro elevation maps to extract real data.</p>
<h2 id="route-planning-algorithm">Route Planning Algorithm</h2>
<p>The core routing uses a simple depth-first search (DFS) to find paths between stations. Delhi Metro&rsquo;s network guarantees connectivity—you can get from any station to any other station, even if it requires multiple transfers.</p>
<p>The algorithm could be optimized with Dijkstra&rsquo;s for shortest paths, but DFS works fine for this use case.</p>
<h2 id="frontend-implementation">Frontend Implementation</h2>
<p>I used Leaflet.js for the interactive map—it&rsquo;s lightweight and handles the station plotting beautifully. The UI is minimal by design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for start/end stations</li>
<li>Visual route display on the map</li>
<li>Step-by-step directions</li>
<li>Transfer information</li>
</ul>
<p>The interface needs work. I know it&rsquo;s not intuitive, but hey:</p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>Vercel made deployment trivial. Push to GitHub, automatic builds, global CDN—done. The app loads fast and handles the interactive map without issues.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start with data</strong>: Good data is harder to find than you think</li>
<li><strong>Simple algorithms work</strong>: DFS solved the routing problem perfectly</li>
<li><strong>Open source everything</strong>: Someone else might find this useful</li>
</ol>
<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/mohit-k-s/meteo">GitHub</a> <br>
The website is live, <a href="https://meteo-v1.vercel.app/">Meteo</a></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Building tools for problems you actually have is the best kind of side project. Even if the UI looks like it was designed in 2005.</em></p>
