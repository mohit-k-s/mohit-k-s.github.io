I spend most of my time working on backend systems — databases, distributed architecture, scaling things that break, and thinking about how things talk to each other. I’m drawn to the edge cases. The weird bugs. The deep internals.
I write to make sense of the world, one entry at a time — sometimes about tech, sometimes about cities I’ve walked through, and sometimes about the strange quiet between thoughts.">

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Mohit.</p>
<p>I spend most of my time working on backend systems — databases, distributed architecture, scaling things that break, and thinking about how things talk to each other. I’m drawn to the edge cases. The weird bugs. The deep internals.</p>
<p>I write to make sense of the world, one entry at a time — sometimes about tech, sometimes about cities I’ve walked through, and sometimes about the strange quiet between thoughts.</p>
<p>This blog is a map of what I’m learning, what I’m building, and what I’m trying to figure out.</p>
<p>Right now still WIP</p>
