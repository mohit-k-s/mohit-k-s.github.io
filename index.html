<p>Hello World, I&rsquo;m Mohit Kumar. I am a backend engineer at Invenco by GVR , I have contributed to the resilience of the entire project by building a lot of internal tools and my understanding of postgres.

<p>After reading <em>Show your work</em> by Austin Kleon, I have started to write more.</p>
<p>I keep re-reading <em>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</em> and it has been a great source of inspiration.</p>
<p>I write about my work and side projects. But sometimes I share my raw thoughts.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of minimalism and I try to live a minimalist life. I try to keep my life simple and clutter free. I try to keep my home clean and organized. I try to keep my work simple and clutter free.</p>
